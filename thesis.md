## Core Thesis

**Fidelity wins by harnessing external innovation, not by trying to out-build it.**

The new apps are agents. Just as mobile apps transformed how customers interacted with financial services, AI agents will become the primary interface for financial discovery, planning, and execution. The companies building these agents will move faster than any single institution — including Fidelity. That's not a threat. It's the opportunity.

Fidelity should become the **app store for financial agents** — a trusted, regulated walled garden where external agents operate on behalf of customers, connecting to Fidelity's markets, execution infrastructure, and regulatory standing. Fidelity owns the marketplace, the review process, the safety net, and the rails. Startups build the agents that sit inside the garden and deliver a superior customer experience.

By leaning into an ecosystem of agents rather than building a single proprietary one, Fidelity gains a structural advantage: **we will always have access to the latest and best agents.** When the next breakthrough in tax optimisation, portfolio construction, or financial planning arrives, it arrives inside our garden — not as a competitor. We don't risk obsolescence because the platform evolves as fast as the ecosystem does. The agents come to us.

This requires assembling the technology stack that makes a regulated agent marketplace possible: orchestration, safety, identity, compliance, audit, and governance infrastructure. That's what we're scouting for.

**What this is NOT:** Internal workflow optimisation. Back-office efficiency. Making life easier for the finance department. This is a major competitive strategy — building the platform that every financial agent needs, not building the agents themselves.

## Why Now

### The Agentic Brokerage Already Shipped

The agentic brokerage is no longer hypothetical. In the last two weeks of March 2026:

- **eToro launched "Agent Portfolios" (March 26)** — bring-your-own-agent model. Users create a sub-portfolio, allocate capital ($200 minimum), connect their own AI agent via scoped API key. Developer-first. Building MCP integration. Extending social trading from "copy a human" to "copy an AI agent."
- **Public.com launched "the world's first Agentic Brokerage" (March 31)** — natural language strategy definition. Users describe intent, the platform builds and executes the agent workflow. Passed eight Series 7 exams. $400M+ raised (Accel, Tiger Global), manages billions in assets.

Neither has a governance layer. Neither has pre-trade compliance. Neither has suitability checks, audit trails, or agent identity management. The infrastructure beneath these products — the part that makes them safe enough for a regulated brokerage — doesn't exist yet.

That's the gap. That's the platform.

### Fidelity Is Regulated — The Technology Must Be Too

Fidelity operates under SEC, FINRA, FCA, and MiFID II obligations. Any agent that touches a customer account, recommends a trade, or executes on behalf of a client must meet the same compliance standards as a human advisor. That's not optional — it's the business.

This means the technology stack powering the agent marketplace must be compliance-native from the ground up: suitability checks, audit trails, explainability, identity management, and human oversight. Off-the-shelf AI tooling built for general enterprise use won't meet the bar.

**Why we scout in Europe:** European startups tend to build compliance, governance, and audit into their architecture by default — a product of operating in a heavily regulated environment (GDPR, DORA, MiFID II, and the incoming EU AI Act). This makes them naturally suited as technology partners for a regulated brokerage. US startups often bolt compliance on later. For Fidelity's purposes, the European supply chain is the better fit.

### Agentic Commerce Went Live — Investment Is Next

- **Visa Intelligent Commerce** produced hundreds of live agent-initiated transactions by December 2025 — world's first agent-completed purchases.
- **Santander + Mastercard** completed Europe's first live AI agent payment on March 2 — first within a regulated banking framework.
- **Santander + Visa** completed LatAm's first agent-powered payments across five markets on March 12.
- **Visa launched "Agentic Ready" in Europe** — Barclays, Commerzbank, HSBC UK, Revolut, Santander signed up.
- **Citi, US Bank, DBS, Westpac, Axis Bank, RBL Bank** all trialling Mastercard Agent Pay or Visa VIC.

Commerce infrastructure (agent identity, payment rails, consent frameworks) is directly reusable for investment. JPMorgan's Mirakl partnership on agentic commerce checkout is the bridge. Public.com and eToro shipping agentic brokerage products compresses the timeline — the transfer from commerce to investment is happening now.

---

## What Others Are Doing (and Why We're Different)

**Building internally:** JPMorgan ($20B tech budget, 450+ AI use cases), Goldman Sachs (Claude for compliance), Citi (182,000 employees with AI tools), Morgan Stanley (OpenAI partnership). Massive internal investment. None building an open agent marketplace.

**Partnering with frontier models:** Santander (OpenAI, 30,000 employees), HSBC (Mistral for custom LLMs). Faster than building, but still tied to a single provider's roadmap.

**Shipping consumer agentic products without governance:** eToro (Agent Portfolios — BYOA via API, developer-first), Public.com ("world's first Agentic Brokerage" — natural language to execution), Arta Finance ($92M — AI wealth management with "Wealth as a Service" for partner banks). All live. None have the compliance, identity, or audit infrastructure that a regulated brokerage requires.

**Nobody is building the platform.** Every approach above either builds agents internally, partners with a model provider, or ships consumer products without governance infrastructure. The regulated agent marketplace — where external agents are certified, governed, and executed safely — is unoccupied.

---

## Our Differentiation

### What Competitors Are Doing

The industry is converging on two approaches, and we believe both are wrong:

**Build it yourself.** JPMorgan is spending $20B and has 450+ AI use cases deployed internally. Goldman Sachs is deploying Anthropic Claude for compliance. Morgan Stanley partnered with OpenAI. Citi has 182,000 employees equipped with generative AI tools. These banks are building proprietary AI capabilities at massive scale — but they're building for internal efficiency, not for an ecosystem. When the next breakthrough agent arrives, it arrives at a startup, not inside JPMorgan.

**Partner with a frontier model provider.** Santander partnered with OpenAI (30,000 employees on ChatGPT Enterprise). HSBC partnered with Mistral. This is faster than building, but it still ties innovation to a single provider's roadmap. And frontier model providers don't build brokerage infrastructure — they build general-purpose AI.

### What We Believe

Neither approach harnesses the full pace of external innovation. The winning strategy is to build the **platform** — the walled garden — and let the entire startup ecosystem compete to deliver superior customer experiences inside it. Fidelity doesn't need to pick the winning agent or the winning model. Fidelity needs to be the place where all of them operate.

This is a fundamentally different bet. Our competitors are trying to build the best internal AI. We're trying to build the best environment for external AI.

### Why European Startups

Fidelity needs compliance-native technology. European startups build that way by default — governance, explainability, and audit baked into the architecture, not bolted on after. They're building for our requirements without us having to ask. That's why we scout primarily in Europe.

## Gap Map: Reimagining Brokerage Infrastructure for Agents

Every function a brokerage performs today — onboarding, compliance, trading, custody, reporting — was designed for human actors. In an agent-first world, each of these must be reimagined. KYC becomes KYA (Know Your Agent). Pre-trade compliance checks must happen in milliseconds against agent-initiated orders. Audit trails must capture agent reasoning, not just human sign-off. Dispute resolution must account for a new actor in the value chain.

The gap map below identifies the infrastructure layers needed to build the app store. For each, we ask: is there a startup building this through an agentic, financial-services-specific lens?

| Layer | Traditional Brokerage Function | Agent-First Reimagining | Status |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Agent Orchestration | Workflow management | Route, schedule, and govern multi-agent workflows | ✅ Jentic (POC partner) |
| AI Safety & Guardrails | Risk controls | Supervise agent behaviour, enforce boundaries, prevent hallucination | ✅ Overmind (strong candidate) |
| Pre-Trade Compliance | Suitability, best execution | Agent checks suitability, concentration limits, restricted lists before every trade | ❌ **Market gap** |
| Agent Authentication | KYC / identity | KYA — Know Your Agent. Permissions, secrets, identity delegation for non-human actors | ❌ No finserv startup |
| Audit & Explainability | Regulatory reporting | "Why did the agent do this?" — auditable, regulator-ready explanation | ❌ No finserv startup |
| Dispute Resolution | Customer complaints | When an agent trade goes wrong, who pays? Insurance, certification, accountability | ❌ Unsolved |
| Tax Optimisation | Tax-lot accounting | Portfolio-integrated TLH, gain deferral, asset location as agent-callable services | ⚠️ Likely internal build |
| Agent Monetisation | Fee schedules | Results-based billing for agent-mediated services | ✅ Paid AI (pattern signal) |

### Gaps With European Startup Coverage

**1. Agent Orchestration & Workflow** ✅ POC Partner
Jentic (Dublin, pre-seed $4.5M). Arazzo workflows, agentic sandboxes, centralised credentials, governed execution. Governance-native architecture. BG Score: 95.

**2. AI Safety & Guardrails** ✅ Strong Candidate
Overmind (London, seed €2.3M). Ex-MI5 founder. AI agent supervision for regulated industries. Fintech explicit target. BG Score: 100.

**3. Compliance — Customer Operations** ✅ Reference Architecture
Gradient Labs (London, Series A $13M). SOP-following agents in regulated banking. Deployed at a major UK bank, 98% CSAT. LHV Bank POC signed. The architectural pattern — procedure-based, auditable, deterministic — is the template for how agents should behave inside the walled garden. BG Score: 82.

**4. Compliance + KYC + Research** ✅ Strong Candidate
Unique AI (Zurich, Series A $30M, $53M total). 25 specialised finserv use cases. Deployed at Pictet, UBP, LGT, SIX, Partners Group. 30,000 users. $2.3T AUM across clients. CPO from Google DeepMind. MCP Hub for secure agent-to-system connections. BG Score: TBD — card pending.

**5. Agentic Commerce Middleware** ✅ Pattern Signal
Lemrock (Paris, seed €6M). Middleware connecting catalogues to LLMs. 60+ brands, 1B+ queries. Architecture transfers to financial product distribution through the marketplace. BG Score: 57.

**6. Agent Monetisation** ✅ Pattern Signal
Paid AI (London, seed $33M). Results-based billing for AI agents. Directly relevant — how does Fidelity charge when an agent in the marketplace generates a trade? BG Score: 53.

**7. Cross-Border Compliance** ✅ Adjacent
Outpost (London, seed $17.5M). Ex-Revolut founders, Ribbit Capital. Cross-border payments and tax compliance. BG Score: 58.

### Genuine Market Gaps (Highest Priority for Scouting)

**8. Pre-Trade Compliance Agent** ❌ FCAT's Most Actionable Insight
Nobody building this. When an AI agent in the marketplace wants to trade, who checks: is this suitable for the client? Does it violate concentration limits? Is the security on a restricted list? Is this best execution? In a world where Public.com ships "describe your intent, we execute" without suitability checks, the company that builds the pre-trade compliance agent owns the governance layer for every agentic brokerage — including the app store. Hadrius (YC, SEC/FINRA native) is the closest signal.

**9. Agent Authentication & Identity** ❌ No FinServ Startup
Ping Identity shipped "Identity for AI" GA. IETF standard being written (draft-klrc-aiagent-auth, March 2026). Horizontal players exist (Composio, Nango, Strata, Runlayer, Aembit, Astrix). Nobody building "Know Your Agent" for financial services. This is the app store's certification system — without it, there's no marketplace.

**10. Audit & Explainability** ❌ No Purpose-Built Startup
Regulators require explainability for AI-driven financial decisions — and so will customers. ValidMind is closest. Nobody building "why did the agent recommend this trade?" as an auditable service. This is the app store's transparency layer.

**11. Dispute Resolution & Agent Liability** ❌ Completely Unsolved
Visa exec: "Now there is a fifth player in the value chain." Armilla (Lloyds-backed AI insurance) and AIUC (agent certification) are embryonic. No framework, no insurance product with traction. This is the app store's consumer protection layer — and it doesn't exist.

### Partial Coverage

**12. Personal Financial Agent** ⚠️
Mistral (Paris, $13.7B) — infrastructure play, not a partner in the traditional sense. Finley AI (London, FCA spotlight) — financial AI agent API. Arta Finance ($92M, US+Singapore) — "Wealth as a Service" reference architecture. No European startup building a personal financial agent specifically — suitability regulation makes it harder to ship fast.

**13. Tax Optimisation Agent** ⚠️ Likely Internal Build
No startup found. Vanguard does daily autonomous TLH internally. This is probably a Fidelity capability question — The Greens has tax APIs, the opportunity is wrapping them agent-ready for the marketplace.

## The Hypothesis: How Agentic Investing Works

To understand what the app store needs, we need to understand how the very best investors actually make decisions — and then imagine each stage of that process as a specialist agent.

### How Elite Traders Actually Work

The best portfolio managers and traders don't just "buy a stock." They execute a multi-stage process that draws on deep, specialised knowledge at every step. Here's the real workflow:

**1. Idea generation.** It starts with signals. Elite traders screen thousands of securities using quantitative filters — valuation metrics, growth rates, momentum signals, earnings revisions. But the edge comes from layering in alternative data that most investors never see: satellite imagery showing retail foot traffic, aggregated credit card transaction data, app download trends, supply chain shipping data, social sentiment analysis. The best funds combine multiple independent data sources because conviction rises when two unrelated signals point the same direction. They also tap human networks — broker research calls, management conversations, industry expert networks — and pattern-match against historical situations where similar setups produced outsized moves.

**2. Research and thesis building.** Once a signal surfaces, the trader builds a thesis — a specific, falsifiable argument for why this security should move. This means deep fundamental analysis: revenue trajectory, margin dynamics, competitive moat, management quality, capital allocation decisions, insider buying patterns. It means identifying specific catalysts — earnings surprises, product launches, regulatory decisions, activist involvement, M&A potential — and structuring a time horizon around them. And it means understanding what the market consensus is and where it's wrong. The best trades are contrarian: the thesis must explain why the market is mispricing the security.

**3. Sentiment and flow analysis.** Before committing capital, the trader reads the room. What's the short interest? What are institutional ownership flows showing — is smart money accumulating or distributing? What's the analyst consensus, and how crowded is it? Order flow analysis reveals whether recent trading has been buyer-initiated or seller-initiated, signalling institutional intent. This isn't just technical analysis — it's understanding the supply/demand dynamics of the security itself.

**4. Portfolio impact assessment.** No trade exists in isolation. The trader calculates: what does adding this position do to the overall portfolio? Does it push sector concentration above limits? Does it introduce correlated risk (adding another semiconductor name when the portfolio is already overweight tech)? What's the marginal contribution to portfolio volatility? Factor analysis reveals hidden exposures — a "diversified" portfolio that's actually just a leveraged bet on interest rates. Scenario modelling shows what happens to the portfolio in a 2-sigma down day, a sector rotation, a liquidity crisis.

**5. Position sizing.** This is where amateurs lose and professionals survive. The size of the position is a direct expression of conviction and risk tolerance. Elite traders work within a risk budget — typically risking 1-2% of capital per position. They use fractional Kelly criterion to determine optimal sizing based on win probability and payoff ratio. A high-conviction thesis with 3:1 risk-reward gets a larger allocation than a speculative idea at 2:1. The question is always: "If I'm completely wrong, how much am I willing to lose?" That answer IS the position size.

**6. Trade structuring.** The trader decides HOW to express the thesis. Direct equity purchase? Options (calls for leverage, puts for hedging, spreads for defined risk)? A pairs trade (long the winner, short the loser in the same sector)? Each structure has different risk/reward profiles, capital requirements, and time decay characteristics. For a wealth management client, this also means deciding WHICH ACCOUNT to trade in — and this is where it gets complex. A high-turnover strategy belongs in a tax-sheltered IRA. A buy-and-hold position belongs in a taxable account. High-dividend stocks go in IRAs to avoid annual tax drag. A covered call programme for income generation might work in the taxable account where the underlying is already held. The optimal account selection depends on the client's entire financial picture.

**7. Tax optimisation.** Before execution, the tax agent runs the numbers across the client's full account structure. If funding this purchase requires a sale, which lot should be sold? Lot #3 might be a short-term loss that offsets $4,200 in gains from January. But selling lot #1 — a long-term holding — triggers capital gains. Can we harvest losses elsewhere in the portfolio to offset? Is there a substantially identical security we can swap into to maintain exposure while capturing the tax benefit? What's the wash sale window? For a Roth conversion analysis, does it make sense to convert this year given the client's income? The difference between tax-aware and tax-unaware execution can be 1-2% of annual return — compounded over decades, that's transformative.

**8. Pre-trade compliance.** The gate. Every proposed action must clear compliance before execution. Is this trade suitable for this client's risk profile, investment objectives, and time horizon? Does it violate concentration limits? Is the security on a restricted list (because the firm has material non-public information)? Does it meet best execution obligations? Are there counterparty risks? Position limits by sector, country, single issuer? What's the liquidity profile — if the client needs to exit quickly, how many days would liquidation take? Compliance is non-negotiable. Violations mean regulatory fines, potential criminal liability, and client harm.

**9. Execution.** Professional execution is nothing like clicking "buy" on an app. The trader selects an execution algorithm matched to order size, urgency, and market conditions. VWAP algorithms spread orders across the day's expected volume to minimise market impact. TWAP distributes evenly over time. For larger orders, portions route to dark pools — private venues where orders are hidden from the public book, preventing information leakage. Smart order routers work across multiple venues simultaneously. The goal is minimising implementation shortfall — the gap between the decision price and the actual execution price. Five basis points of slippage on a large order is real money.

**10. Position monitoring.** The trade is live. Now the thesis must be monitored continuously. Is the fundamental case still intact? Have earnings or guidance changed? Has a competitor made an unexpected announcement? Has the macro backdrop shifted? The trader watches specific thesis milestones — if the catalyst doesn't materialise by the expected date, the thesis may be broken. Stop-losses and profit targets enforce discipline: if the position hits 2-3x the initial risk, take profits. If it hits the stop, exit regardless of emotion. Maximum Favourable Excursion analysis tracks whether the trader is capturing enough of each move or leaving money on the table.

**11. Rebalancing and exit.** Positions don't stay optimal. A winner that's outperformed now represents 8% of the portfolio instead of the target 3% — the trader must trim to maintain diversification. Correlations shift over time, creating hidden concentration. Rebalancing is mechanical and emotion-free — the portfolio must stay within risk parameters. Exits happen for specific reasons: catalyst realised and priced in, thesis broken, profit target hit, or portfolio rebalancing required. Each exit decision also loops back through the tax optimisation stage — is this the right time to realise this gain or loss?

**12. Post-trade analysis and learning.** Every closed position gets a forensic review. Was the thesis correct? Was the entry well-timed? What was the maximum adverse excursion (worst drawdown)? Did the exit capture the optimal amount of the move? Over hundreds of trades, patterns emerge — which setups work, which market regimes favour the strategy, where the process breaks down. Trade journals, attribution analysis (how much return came from stock selection vs sector allocation vs timing), and systematic learning loops are what separate elite traders from everyone else.

**13. Behavioural coaching.** For wealth management clients, the most valuable intervention is often preventing a bad decision. When markets crash 20%, the natural human response is to panic and sell at the bottom. The best advisors prepare clients in advance for drawdowns, provide perspective during volatility, and enforce discipline when emotions run high. This is a distinct skill from portfolio construction — it's behavioural psychology applied to finance.

**14. Financial planning overlay.** Everything above operates within the context of the client's actual life. A 30-year-old accumulating wealth has a different optimal strategy than a 70-year-old in drawdown. Life events — marriage, children, job change, inheritance, retirement — require portfolio restructuring. Income generation (dividends, covered calls) matters for retirees. Estate planning (step-up-in-basis, trusts, charitable giving) matters for wealth transfer. The planning agent ensures that no short-term trade decision undermines the client's long-term objectives.

### Now Imagine Every Stage as an Agent

In the app store, each of these fourteen stages is handled by a specialist agent — or a constellation of agents — built by a startup that does one thing brilliantly. A customer's personal agent initiates a conversation that flows through these specialists:

"I want more semiconductor exposure" triggers a cascade: the **research agent** analyses the sector and surfaces candidates. The **portfolio agent** checks existing exposure and models the impact. The **sizing agent** recommends allocation based on conviction and risk budget. The **structuring agent** evaluates equity vs options vs pairs. The **tax agent** finds the optimal execution path across account types. The **compliance agent** gates the trade. The **execution agent** places the order. The **monitoring agent** watches the position. And when conditions change, the conversation begins again.

The output is a better decision than any single agent — or most human advisors — could produce, because it draws on deep specialist knowledge at every stage. And every step is auditable, explainable, and governed inside the garden.

**This is the customer experience that the app store delivers.** Fidelity provides the garden. Startups provide the intelligence. The customer gets the combined brainpower of the entire ecosystem.

---

## What We're Scouting For

Everything required to make the above flow real. This spans two categories: the **specialist agents** that deliver the customer experience, and the **platform infrastructure** that makes the garden safe.

### Specialist Agents (The Apps)

These are the startups building deep domain intelligence that agents can draw on. Each maps to one or more stages of the investment process above.

1. **Personal Financial Agent** — The front door. Understands the customer's goals, translates intent into action, orchestrates the conversation across specialists. *(Stages 1, 13, 14)*
2. **Research & Signal Intelligence Agent** — Alternative data, earnings analysis, sector research, catalyst identification, sentiment analysis, institutional flow tracking. The knowledge layer that generates ideas and validates theses. *(Stages 1, 2, 3)*
3. **Portfolio Construction & Risk Agent** — Concentration analysis, factor exposure, correlation modelling, scenario analysis, position sizing, rebalancing triggers. Knows what you own and what adding or removing a position does to the whole. *(Stages 4, 5, 11)*
4. **Trade Structuring Agent** — Equity vs options vs pairs vs ETFs. Account selection across taxable, IRA, Roth, 529. Structures the expression of a thesis for optimal risk/reward and tax efficiency. *(Stage 6)*
5. **Tax Optimisation Agent** — Lot-level tax-loss harvesting, gain deferral, asset location, wash sale prevention, Roth conversion analysis. Operates on the live portfolio in real time across all account types. Not tax filing. *(Stage 7)*
6. **Options & Derivatives Strategy Agent** — Covered calls for income, protective puts, spreads for defined risk, collar strategies, volatility trading. Deep specialist knowledge that most retail investors can't access today. *(Stages 6, 10)*
7. **Execution Agent** — Algorithm selection (VWAP, TWAP, POV), dark pool routing, multi-venue smart order routing, slippage minimisation. Professional-grade execution for everyone. *(Stage 9)*
8. **Position Monitoring & Thesis Tracking Agent** — Continuous monitoring of thesis milestones, stop-loss/profit-target management, catalyst tracking, earnings surprises, macro regime changes. Initiates new conversations when conditions change. *(Stage 10)*
9. **Financial Planning Agent** — Goals-based planning, retirement projections, life event modelling, income generation strategy, estate considerations. The long-term guardrail that prevents short-term decisions from undermining the client's actual objectives. *(Stage 14)*
10. **Behavioural Coaching Agent** — Panic prevention, discipline enforcement, drawdown perspective, portfolio-consistent decision support. The agent that stops you selling at the bottom. *(Stage 13)*
11. **Post-Trade Analysis & Learning Agent** — Trade journaling, attribution analysis, pattern recognition across closed positions, strategy refinement. The feedback loop that makes the entire system smarter over time. *(Stage 12)*

### Platform Infrastructure (The Garden)

These are the startups building the technology that makes the agent marketplace safe, compliant, and trustworthy.

7. **Agent Orchestration** — Routes conversations between agents, manages workflows, enforces execution order. Jentic (Dublin, POC partner, BG Score: 95) is the current lead.
8. **AI Safety & Guardrails** — Supervises agent behaviour, prevents hallucination, enforces boundaries. The referee. Overmind (London, BG Score: 100) is the strongest candidate.
9. **Pre-Trade Compliance** — The gate. Checks suitability, concentration limits, restricted lists, best execution before any trade executes. Nobody is building this. Genuine market gap.
10. **Agent Authentication & Identity (KYA)** — Know Your Agent. Every agent in the garden must be certified, permissioned, and accountable. The app store's admission system.
11. **Audit & Explainability** — Records every agent conversation and decision. "Why did the agent recommend this?" must be answerable for regulators and customers.
12. **Dispute Resolution & Agent Liability** — When the conversation produces a bad outcome, who's responsible? Insurance, certification, accountability frameworks. Completely unsolved.
13. **Agent Monetisation** — How each specialist agent gets paid. Results-based billing, revenue sharing, subscription models for agent-mediated services. Paid AI (London, BG Score: 53) is a pattern signal.

## What "Good" Looks Like

- **Stage:** Seed to Series A (we want to shape what the startup is building, not adopt a finished product)
- **Geography:** Europe preferred, global acceptable
- **FinServ readiness:** Evidence of financial services traction, customers, or regulated-industry DNA
- **Team:** Domain expertise in financial services, AI/ML, or security. Prior startup experience valued
- **Architecture:** API-first, platform thinking, not point solutions
- **Governance-native:** Compliance, audit, and explainability as foundational design — not bolted on

### Learned Preferences (from 8 votes)

- **Trust infrastructure wins:** Agent Auth & Security and AI Safety & Guardrails have 100% upvote rates (4/4 at 4–5★). Strongest signal.
- **Sub-domain precision matters:** Accounting automation ≠ agent orchestration (Stacks, 2★). Tax filing ≠ portfolio tax intelligence (TaxDown, 2★). Right category, wrong product flavour = miss.
- **Not internal tooling:** This thesis is about external innovation harnessed through a regulated marketplace. Companies optimising internal workflows (bookkeeping, back-office automation, finance department efficiency) are out of scope regardless of their AI sophistication.
- **Preferred tax sub-domain:** Portfolio-integrated, dynamic, advisor-workflow-embedded. Not consumer e-filing.
- **Compliance dual failure mode:** Wrong sub-domain (KYC/AML framing) and undifferentiated execution (architecturally generic) are two distinct ways to miss.

---

## Signals That Challenge the Thesis

1. **Incumbents claiming agent infrastructure** — Visa Intelligent Commerce Connect is building protocol-agnostic agent payment infrastructure. Mastercard Virtual C-Suite positions them as the agentic intelligence layer. If payment networks own the agent rails, the app store's value proposition narrows.
2. **Governance becoming a platform feature** — Sycamore raised $65M for a "trusted agent OS." If governance is a feature of orchestration platforms rather than standalone infrastructure, the startup opportunity in safety/compliance shrinks.
3. **Horizontal players moving into finserv** — Okta launched "Identity for AI Agents." AI safety companies are being acquired by platform incumbents (OpenAI/Promptfoo, SentinelOne/Prompt Security, Check Point/Lakera). The window for finserv-specific startups to establish themselves is compressing.
4. **Agents bypassing brokerages entirely** — If eToro and Public.com build their own execution infrastructure and succeed without traditional brokerage rails, the "agents must come through us" thesis weakens.
